My Flutter and Laravel Project
Introduction
As a beginner in Flutter, I have been learning the basics of Flutter development through various resources such as the WsCube Tech YouTube channel, Simplilearn Introduction to Flutter Course videos by Aditya Thakur, and other YouTube videos. After gaining knowledge in simple Dart programming and Flutter widgets, I decided to create a simple project like a to-do list using Flutter. As I became more interested in how Android apps work with servers, I combined the todo app with Laravel authentication API.
